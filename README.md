# Flappy Bird Game Project

Welcome to my Flappy Bird game project! This game is designed and developed using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of what i have learn and achieve through this project:

1. **Game Loop Creation**: Learn to set up the main game loop to keep the game running smoothly.
2. **Canvas Manipulation**: Add and manipulate images on the canvas to bring your game to life.
3. **Click Handlers**: Implement click handlers to make the flappy bird jump with user interactions.
4. **Random Pipe Generation**: Create pipes that randomly generate and move across the screen.
5. **Collision Detection**: Detect collisions between the flappy bird and pipes to manage game over scenarios.
6. **Score Tracking**: Add a running score to keep track of the player's progress.

This project is a fantastic way to enhance your JavaScript skills while creating a fun and interactive game. Dive in and enjoy coding your own Flappy Bird game! ðŸš€
